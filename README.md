The Holy BIBL in your REPL

## Usage
List of books:
```clojure
holy-bibl.core=> (books)
("Gen" "Exod" "Lev" "Num" "Deut" "Josh" "Judg" "Ruth" "Sam1" "Sam2" "Kgs1" "Kgs2" "Chr1" "Chr2" "Ezra" "Neh" "Esth" "Job" "Ps" "Prov" "Eccl" "Song" "Isa" "Jer" "Lam" "Ezek" "Dan" "Hos" "Joel" "Amos" "Obad" "Jonah" "Mic" "Nah" "Hab" "Zeph" "Hag" "Zech" "Mal" "Matt" "Mark" "Luke" "John" "Acts" "Rom" "Cor1" "Cor2" "Gal" "Eph" "Phil" "Col" "Thess1" "Thess2" "Tim1" "Tim2" "Titus" "Phlm" "Heb" "Jas" "Pet1" "Pet2" "John1" "John2" "John3" "Jude" "Rev")
```
books are functions:
```clojure
holy-bibl.core=> (Gen "1:14-16")
("And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:" "and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so." "And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.")
```
number of books are postfixed as by default Clojure does not accept functions names starting with digits (e.g. "3John" become "John3")

Chapter and verse system is the standard, e.g.: (John "3:14–16") or (John "3.14–16") refers to the book of John, chapter 3, verses 14 through 16
